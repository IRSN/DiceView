	* all code changed with a normalized style (e.g. spacings between
	'=' and args) and indentation . Used '<-' for affectations in place  
	of '=' (recommandation given in manuals).

	* 'doc' added liks to DeceKriging/DiceEval functions. Removed the 
	\value{} sections as is usual for functions that do not return 
	anything. Added doc for new args. Added first names for authors
	for better citation.
	
	* sectionview3d* added 'col_points' and 'col_surf' args to change the 	
	colors. Aded col_needles in order to add needles for 3D-plots (only).
	Formal args with long names such as 'background_blending' 
	were renamed to shorter names as 'bg_blend' in order to have better  
	looking documentation.

	* sectionview3d*: used 'apply' and 'scale' function to avoid loops.

	* 'translude' and 'fade'functions added to the package for a possible 
	general use. Not exported nor documented. Code in file 'Utils.R'.

	* 'tryFormat' function added (still experimental) to format
	the center vector in titles. It is nessary to get a good number
	of decimals so that "colmeans" or random values in 'center' 
	should not have too many decimals.
